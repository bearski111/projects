I use a Genymotion emulator to run my apps, and I was unable to see your application through this emulator. I also tried to run the code on a classmate’s mac, and experienced the same issues. Running it on the Mac allowed to me to take away a few things:
Line 7: “Home” has an extra apostrophe which is not needed
Line 89 missing semicolon
Line 119 and 120 have a lot of grammar errors. I recommend taking away the semicolons and fixing spacing issues to solve this issue.
Overall, in regards to the tea code specifically. I am unsure why you created the section of coding dealing with orientation. I am unable to see what that does, but for this app I’d recommend just following what is laid out in the book and maybe this will fix the errors creating the viewing issues. (This could also just be due to the emulator and older computer I am using to run it, so I apologize if that is the case).
